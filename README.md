# Gender Classification Using Machine Learning
## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques for gender classification based on physical features. It utilizes various algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Weighted KNN, Naive Bayes, and more to predict gender based on the given input features.

The dataset used contains physical attributes like long hair, forehead width, and nose size, among others, to classify individuals as male or female.
